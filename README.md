# Personal Income & Expense Tracker
## Step 1:
Create a MongoDB atlas database and generate sample data with the help of "MongoDB Database creation and sample data generation.ipynb" file.
"personal_income_expense_tracker.users_financials.csv" and "personal_income_expense_tracker.users_information.csv" are the two collections that we deployed on to mongoDB. "personal_income_expense_tracker.users_financials.csv" stores financial infromation of all the users in a single document for each month. "personal_income_expense_tracker.users_information.csv" stores user specific infromation once the user signup to the application.
## Step 2: 
Create a web application using .py files and deploy the application 
-- app.py contains the code of Flask application.
-- streamlit_app.py contains the code of Front-end web application.
-- requirements.txt contains the packages with versions required.
The final deployed application URL: https://adt-streamlit-app.onrender.com/![image](https://github.com/godhaprathima/Personal_Income_Expense_Tracker/assets/59764991/d98d1335-b71c-4f32-9dc8-af38990cd104)
