# Personal Income & Expense Tracker
## Step 1:
Create a MongoDB atlas database and generate sample data with the help of "MongoDB Database creation and sample data generation.ipynb" file.

The structure of the database will be as follows: 

-- "personal_income_expense_tracker.users_financials" and "personal_income_expense_tracker.users_information" are the two collections that we deployed on to mongoDB. 

-- "personal_income_expense_tracker.users_financials" stores financial infromation of all the users in a single document for each month. "personal_income_expense_tracker.users_information" 
stores user specific infromation once the user signup to the application.
## Step 2: 
Create a web application using .py files and deploy the application 

-- app.py contains the code of Flask application.

-- streamlit_app.py contains the code of Front-end web application.

-- requirements.txt contains the packages with versions required.

The final application can be deployed.
